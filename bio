Currently, I am completing a Computer Programming Certificate, with tracks in Database Development and Software Development at Seattle Central College. My future career goals include working for a major tech company to help develop database driven software and leading my own team of software engineers. I have a BA in Philosophy, with a specialization in Phenomenology, Hermeneutics and Post-Modernism from Seattle University. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, spending time with family and friends, and crocheting.
