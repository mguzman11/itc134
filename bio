At this time, I am completing a Computer Programming Certificate, with tracks in Database Development 
and Software Development at Seattle Central College. My future career goals include working for a major tech company to help 
develop database driven software. I have a BA in Philosophy, with a specialization in Phenomenology, Hermeneutics and 
Post-Modernism from Seattle University. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, spending time with family and friends, and 
crocheting.
